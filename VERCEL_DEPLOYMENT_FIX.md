# Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Vercel was running `vite` (dev server) instead of `vite build` (production build).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `frontend/vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "env": {
    "VITE_USE_PRODUCTION": "true"
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Environment Auto-Detection:
The app now automatically detects when it's running on Vercel and uses production URLs.

### 3. Deployment Steps:

1. **Make sure you're deploying from the `frontend` folder on Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Project Settings ‚Üí General
   - Root Directory: `frontend`

2. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   - VITE_USE_PRODUCTION=true
   - VITE_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=86fqhsbqb2ba3g
   - VITE_LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/linkedin

3. **Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

### 4. Expected Build Output:
You should see:
```
Running "npm run build"
Building for production...
Build completed successfully
```

Instead of:
```
Running "vite" (dev server)
```

## Manual Deployment Alternative

If automatic deployment still fails, you can deploy manually:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

## Verification

After successful deployment, check the browser console for:
